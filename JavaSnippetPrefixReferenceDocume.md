This reference document should help you quickly find and use the appropriate snippet for your Java programming needs, enhancing productivity and maintaining consistency across your projects.

In programming editors and IDEs, **code folding** is a feature that allows users to expand or collapse regions of code to make it easier to manage and navigate large files. The levels of folding, such as level 1, level 2, etc., refer to the hierarchical organization of code blocks that can be folded or unfolded independently. Here’s a breakdown of what these levels typically represent:

### Level 1 Folding
- **Top-level folding**: This usually includes the highest structural elements in a file. In a Java file, for example, level 1 folds might include entire classes, interfaces, or enums.

### Level 2 Folding
- **Member-level folding**: This level typically includes members of a class or interface, such as methods, constructors, and static blocks. In structured data files like JSON or XML, this might include top-level nodes or objects.

### Subsequent Levels (Level 3, Level 4, etc.)
- **Inner blocks**: These levels deal with more nested structures. For instance, in a Java method, a level 3 fold might include loops, conditionals, or try-catch blocks. Each deeper level corresponds to a further nested block or structure.
- **Fine-grained details**: At deeper levels, even smaller code segments like individual if conditions, smaller loops within other loops, or case blocks within a switch statement might be foldable.

### Usage
- **Navigation and readability**: By folding and unfolding different levels, a developer can quickly navigate through parts of a large codebase, focusing on higher-level structures without getting distracted by the details of implementation.
- **Editing**: When refactoring or reviewing code, it’s useful to be able to hide parts of the code that are not currently relevant, reducing cognitive load and visual clutter.

Most modern IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, or Eclipse automatically support multiple levels of code folding and allow users to customize which types of code blocks should be foldable.
